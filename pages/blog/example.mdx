There are multiple stages involved in the process of deploying an app, for example installing dependencies. For Now to recognize that an app needs a build step, that app will need a `Dockerfile`, which will contain all of the build steps for the app.

Using a `Dockerfile` is to define the process of an app being built on Now, which will deploy the app after the build process using the `Dockerfile` configuration.

During the build process, information that needs to be used at that time might not be safe to hard code into the app or preferred to be kept in a configuration file for the app. In this case, Now supports a method that allows assigning an environment variable or secret for deployments to use during build time.

## Step 1: Setting up Build Environment Variables and Secrets
To use custom environment variables or secrets in the build process on Now, there are two methods.

### The `now.json` method
Provide a Now deployment with environment variables directly from within the `now.json` configuration file. To do so for the build step, the environment variables must be within the `build.env` property. For example:

```
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production"
    }
  }
}
```
